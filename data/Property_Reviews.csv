Looks exactly like the pictures, has a very nice and cute look done to the apartment very aesthetic and has a pretty view of some of Calgary's sky line as well, it also has everything you need from amenities to a stocked up kitchen to help you going with any cooking you might do. Ben and Fay were very responsive with the way they handled any problems I had.  It's also right in the middle of Calgary so everything's close by. The only problems I faced here would be 1. No elevator so you must climb 4 flights of stairs. 2. Parking is a bit iffy as they don't have a parking stall so you would be parking around the area, which was easily solved by the instructions listed at check in, which tell you were to park, max 2 min walk from parking area to your apt. 3. No AC, but at least for me the fan they provided was enough for me, if its still to hot, the hosts would be willing to provide you with an extra fan. Overall 8.5/10 stay!!!",August 2024,,en

The bed mattress is covered with pee and sweat stains the cover is really old… The couch in the living room had noticeable stains as well.

The loft had a great location with plenty of restaurants nearby, a generally safe area, and convenient features like a yoga studio across the street. It was clean and modern, with a lovely overhead shower, a new kitchen, and a cute shop, ‘Tuu,’ downstairs. Have a parking space was great too.

However, there were some privacy concerns. The host attached an AirTag to the keys, which tracked my location and sent notifications to my iPhone (and coworkers iPhones at work), making me feel monitored. Additionally, a camera by the front door records your comings and goings. Noise from people walking upstairs every morning also made it hard to sleep since the bed is so close to the ceiling.

While the price and location were great, the constant feeling of being tracked detracted from the stay. Great for some, but privacy-conscious travelers may want to think twice.

Pros:
- Beautiful apartment
- very clean
- the rainshower was exquisite
- it's location is great for walking to restaurants and stores
- secure building
- parking space
- Mike was very responsive

Cons:
- The building is right beside a train track, and the sound of the trains are loud enough to get through the walls. We were woken up every night from the trains
- The bed situation leaves something to be desired. You have to kind of crawl on your hands and knees to get into the bed. There's also no place for side tables. As someone who drinks water throughout the night, I had to shove my water bottle between the mattress and the railing
- The breakers seem a tad... weak? The breaker for the oven had been tripped when we arrived, and using a hair dryer tripped the breaker for the bathroom

Overall, we had a great time here! Just consider the bed situation if you have any knee issues or other physical ailments.",October 2024,,en

I had an incredible experience staying at this charming Airbnb in the Bridgeland area! From the moment I arrived, I was blown away by how cozy and welcoming the space was. The fireplace added a warm, inviting atmosphere, perfect for relaxing after a day of exploring.

The rooftop patio was an absolute highlight – stunning views of the city and the perfect spot to unwind with a drink or enjoy the sunset. The location couldn’t be better either – there are fantastic coffee shops, delicious restaurants, and everything you need just a short walk away.

The host was simply amazing – friendly, responsive, and truly went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed. It felt like staying at a friend’s place, with that extra touch of hospitality.

It was a pleasant condo. I was impressed with the amount of space and privacy we had. We brought our cat and he made himself at home. There was so much attention put into comfort. We really did enjoy our time. And the bedding was so cozy. The fireplace was warm and very pretty. It was nice to pull out the bed in the living room to snuggle up and watch Netflix.

I had an absolutely delightful stay at this BNB! The unit itself was clean, cozy, and beautifully decorated, with all the amenities you’d need for a comfortable stay.

The only minor challenge was finding the key—it felt like I was solving a mini escape room puzzle! The key storage was located across the street, which added a bit of adventure to the check-in process. That said, I must admit it was fun (if you have the energy for it) and gave me a little story to tell about my trip.

Overall, a wonderful place that I would highly recommend to anyone. Just prepare for a small scavenger hunt at the start, and you’ll be rewarded with a fantastic stay!",December 2024,,en

The suite is new, well equipped, bright, and comfortable. It is well suited for long term stays. The location makes it almost effortless to explore what Calgary has to offer. If you want to go downtown, find a restaurant, or hit up a fitness centre, they are all close by. If you want to get across or out of of the city, the big highways are close by too. 

The only downside that is worth mentioning is the proximity to railroad tracks. There is a considerable amount of train traffic with the usual rumbling, dinging, and screeching that cargo trains make. While not a constant, you can expect it any time of day or night. If your brain filters out these sort of urban sounds, then you will likely be happy and comfortable here.",May 2024,,en

All the filters (intake & furnace/AC) were full & needed to be changed & host said it would be done while I was there but it didn't happen, but maybe they were busy. This made it hard for the AC to get to 21°c. I was shown a couple other units by the host & they all had in common loud workings (AC, etc.). It's just a loud building so not great if you're sensitive to that for sleep. One bedroom has a flashing neon light outside day& night but a blackout blind or a blanket over the window can fix that.

There is a touchscreen which is used to enter a dial code, which will ring the hosts cell phone. The touchscreen doesn’t default to code enter screen, you have to hit the ‘CODE #’ button in the top right of the screen. 
Once you enter the provided code it will dial the hosts phone number, they will then push a button on their phone to open both of the front door AND will ‘unlock’ the elevator access to the floor.
If you follow someone through the door without the host ‘buzzing’ you in, you won’t be able to use the elevator to get to your floor.

**This is only required for your very first check in.**

Once you have the fob, you’re good to go.

There’s a great restaurant a short walk up the street called blue star, highly recommend. And the pharmacy across the street is super convenient.",October 2024,,en

You get a key for your own bedroom, so you can lock everything inside whenever you leave the apartment or during the night. Everything in this Airbnb is brandnew. The bed and the blanket is extremely comfortable! The entire apartment is super modern and newly renovated. The kitchen has everything you need!
The C-Train Station is a 10 min walk and within another 10 min ride you‘re in downtown. Same with the bus station, the bus brings you to Inglewood within 10 min, which is the nicest neighborhood in Calgary in my opinion.

When trying to check in, we were bounced between three different representatives before eventually being connected with the person who was to hand over the keys to us. 
Once checked in, we experienced consistent beeping (24 hours a day, for the entire stay) from the fire alarm panel located directly outside the unit door. There was louder, more disruptive fire alarm testing happening for the week we were there - which the host was apparently unaware of (even though a notice was posted in the elevator, dated 15 days prior to our arrival). Our host repeatedly promised compensation for the disruption, but eventually stopped responding altogether. Even now, the last message I have from them says they're 'investigating'. 
I'd strongly recommend booking elsewhere - if anything goes wrong with your stay, you'll need to escalate to AirBnb directly because in our experience, attempting to work directly with the host is useless.",July 2024,,en

The location is excellent - so close to downtown and perfectly situated off of the bike paths. The neighborhood itself was quiet and parking was seamless. There was a lot of residual noise from the neighboring units during the day, but it was likely due to temporary construction.

In terms of the star reduction: The AC unit in the bedroom is great, but gets extremely loud at random intervals, which makes it difficult to sleep with it running.

It’s a  lower rental unit and being older noise comes through floor. The furnace has a whine that younger ears would find extremely annoying. The toilet is jammed into a cubby about 28” wide and you cannot maneuver. At the end of my stay I was texted to do the dishes. Up front I paid a cleaning fee yet this was not mentioned. I did leave 10$ for the maid. After a long trip I couldn’t get the keypad lock to open- I called the rental people who said they couldn’t help me. I called both of these guys- voicemail on both lines. Texted through ABB and got it figured out. This is my first stay where I never talked or met the hosts. It seems like AI is  handling these texts. While entering the house there is an apple tree- looks like the entire tree dropped its apples as they were rotting on the ground.

The bed could do better with a softer mattress topper, but all in all, our experience with Ahmed and in his place was very pleasant. Thank you lots!",December 2024,,en

The bathroom was clean, with a lovely big mirror great for getting ready and a nice strong shower over a great size bath and all the amenities you needed, included a lot of towels and linen, as well as access to washer / dryer.  Hosts were great, very responsive and accommodating. 

We honestly couldn’t recommend this place more - it’s better than the photos, great price, super safe & home from home!",January 2025,,en

Shawn's Airbnb is in the basement of the property and is quite huge.Its very modern and clean and has everything that you need including cooking facilities.
 *THE BAD* Just like the guest Sharon who stayed there just before myself and my partner,we too encountered the same problems with the tenants upstairs( who we found out only moved in a few weeks ago)we'd hear walking heavily across their upstairs floor and could hear their music too! 
 I got in touch with Shawn who was quick to sort it out for me but it would start again a while later! 
 It was because of this that we decided to check out after only two nights and book ourselves elsewhere for the remainder of our 1 week stay.Shawn gave us a 4 night refund even though I believe we should have had 5 nights refund as we left by 11am after our second night!
 Shawn offered us his other Airbnb across the road but we'd already booked up our hotel which was non refundable.

It’s a  lower rental unit and being older noise comes through floor. The furnace has a whine that younger ears would find extremely annoying. The toilet is jammed into a cubby about 28” wide and you cannot maneuver. At the end of my stay I was texted to do the dishes. Up front I paid a cleaning fee yet this was not mentioned. I did leave 10$ for the maid. After a long trip I couldn’t get the keypad lock to open- I called the rental people who said they couldn’t help me. I called both of these guys- voicemail on both lines. Texted through ABB and got it figured out. This is my first stay where I never talked or met the hosts. It seems like AI is  handling these texts. While entering the house there is an apple tree- looks like the entire tree dropped its apples as they were rotting on the ground. The internet went out for 2 days- maybe the snowing had something to do with that. It’s really dark in the rear where you park and threes sets of dark outside stairs,November 2024,,en

When trying to check in, we were bounced between three different representatives before eventually being connected with the person who was to hand over the keys to us. 
Once checked in, we experienced consistent beeping (24 hours a day, for the entire stay) from the fire alarm panel located directly outside the unit door. There was louder, more disruptive fire alarm testing happening for the week we were there - which the host was apparently unaware of (even though a notice was posted in the elevator, dated 15 days prior to our arrival). Our host repeatedly promised compensation for the disruption, but eventually stopped responding altogether. Even now, the last message I have from them says they're 'investigating'. 
I'd strongly recommend booking elsewhere - if anything goes wrong with your stay, you'll need to escalate to AirBnb directly because in our experience, attempting to work directly with the host is useless.",July 2024,,en

Moreover, there were pieces of glasses both inside and outside, in the balcony. If we hadn’t noticed the glasses on the floor soon enough or if we hadn’t brought our own slippers, they could’ve caused injury. 

The balcony was unusable because it was full of bird poop and hadn’t been cleaned for a long time. 

The bed was noisy, it squeaked with every movement and we couldn’t sleep well.

If you want to cook, you need to buy all sort of spices and condiments yourself. This place didn’t even have salt!

Firstly, Ritvik and his wife gave us a tour of the place upon check-in. Just knowing where everything was made us feel right at home. The neighbourhood itself is very quiet and there's a grocery store 5ish mins drive from the house or a 15ish min walk. We slept very well as the bed and pillows were comfortable.
Totally unexpected, but they invited us to have a couple of dinners with them and it was hard to resist since the food smelled so yummy. The food was amazing and they were generous enough to share recipes with us. I'm happy that I now know how to make chai!!!
We really felt at home!
Even though we were all staying in the same house, we didnt feel like we were in each other's way. My partner and I had a lot of privacy.
If you're travelling and working from home, you'll love the private office - with an external monitor!

Longer term, there’s a heated underground lot for $22/day a block away (far side of the Harry Hays building). Lockbox instructions for check in were very clear. Inside, there are a handful of steps to go up and then there’s an elevator. It didn’t look like there was an option around the steps for people with mobility barriers.

Moreover, there were pieces of glasses both inside and outside, in the balcony. If we hadn’t noticed the glasses on the floor soon enough or if we hadn’t brought our own slippers, they could’ve caused injury. 

The balcony was unusable because it was full of bird poop and hadn’t been cleaned for a long time. 

The bed was noisy, it squeaked with every movement and we couldn’t sleep well.

If you want to cook, you need to buy all sort of spices and condiments yourself. This place didn’t even have salt!
